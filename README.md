# count_zero_bits
# Count Zero Bits in Binary Representation

This is a simple C program that counts the number of zero bits in the binary representation of a given decimal number.

## Description

The program reads an unsigned decimal number from the user, converts it to binary internally, and counts how many bits are zero in its binary form. It then prints the count to the user.

## How to Use

1. Compile the program using a C compiler, for example:
   ```bash
   gcc -o count_zero_bits main.c
   ./count_zero_bits
```bash

2.
 ## Download

For Windows users, you can download and run the program directly:
